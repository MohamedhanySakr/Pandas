# Pandas
All you need to know about Pandas
## What is pandas ?
In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
The pandas package is the most important tool at the disposal of Data Scientists and Analysts working in Python today. The powerful machine learning and glamorous visualization tools may get all the attention, but pandas is the backbone of most data projects.

#### I work on Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook) to make it clear 
How to install pandas ?
pip install pandas
conda install pandas

#### What are the main data structures in the pandas library ?
Series: one-dimensional labeled arrays pd. Series(data)
DataFrames: two-dimensional data structure with columns, much like a table.

## What is series ?
pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index.

## What is DataFrame ?
Is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects. It is generally the most commonly used pandas object.
